--- regular_chat()
To save money in the bank, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Ask a grown-up to help you open a bank account. You will need to fill out some forms and provide some information.

2. Once your bank account is open, you can deposit money into it. You can do this by giving the money to the bank teller or using an ATM.

3. Your money will be safe in the bank, and you can watch it grow over time. The bank may even give you some extra money called "interest" for keeping your money there.

4. If you want to save more money, you can keep adding to your bank account whenever you have extra money to save.

Remember, it's always good to save some of your money in the bank for the future! If you have any more questions or need help, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
