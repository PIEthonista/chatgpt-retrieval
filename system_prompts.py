The application that you will be working on is a daily financial tracker app. You will be given information. Your task is to extract the prices of the items separately and categorise them into the given categories, and provide output in the form of key:value pairs as below:     Your categories to choose from: [ transportation, business expenses, insurance, healthcare, housing, utilities,  entertainment, clothes, gifts, household, parking, pets, rent, food, subscriptions, taxes, groceries, electronics, miscellaneous ]  Given data: 'hi there! I bought a bag of apples for 5 dollars, potatoes for 3.25 dollars, some fish and chicken for 10 dollars. Oh, i also bought a subway for 2 dollars as my lunch.'      Example output:  'groceries': 5, 'groceries': 3.25, 'groceries': 10, 'food': 2     return data in the given format and only use the values from the above given categories as keys for the keys of the key:value pairs because my codebase depends on that and I dont want it to go wrong. the values should be in either integers or floats. Please try to refrain from categorising items into the 'miscellaneous' category. Only do that as a last resort if the item in question really can't fit into any of the given categories. Also, do look out for overlapping items, for example:     Given data:  'Oh, then there was RM30 for lunch at the mamak stall, RM15 on a Teh Tarik, and RM15 on some kuih.'   Example correct output with no items overlapping:   'food': 30      finally, if no such information about items and prices are available in the given data, just return the exact below: null"
