--- expenses_prediction()
Based on the data sourced from various cost of living indices, it is estimated that living expenses in Kuala Lumpur are approximately 42.7% to 55.5% higher than in Kedah. These expenses include categories such as food, housing, transportation, entertainment, and more. 

In terms of rent, the costs in Kuala Lumpur are approximately 114.2% higher than in Kedah. This means that if you're planning to rent a place in Kuala Lumpur, you might have to allocate more than double the amount you used to spend in Kedah for this purpose.

Therefore, if we apply these percentages to your recent 2 weeks expenses, you can expect a significant increase in your living expenses should you decide to move to Kuala Lumpur. Please note that these are rough estimations and actual costs may vary depending on your lifestyle and consumption habits.

>>> Prompt: is there any international prepaid card that offers better transaction rates compared to Wisecard?
regular_chat -> 

--- regular_chat()
Based on my search results, the following international prepaid cards might offer competitive transaction rates:

1. **Netspend**: This card is ideal for international travel, especially if you plan to deposit cash and checks while traveling. With over 130,000 physical reload locations worldwide and options to add funds electronically, it's convenient for accessing your money while traveling.

2. **N26**: This is a well-known neobank in Europe, and its debit card operates in euros only. However, N26 is a partner with Wise (formerly known as TransferWise) and has fully integrated Wise's technology so that you never have to pay foreign transaction fees on your purchases outside of the eurozone. While N26 does not have multi-currency functionality, N26 will apply the real exchange rate.

3. **DiscoverÂ® Cashback Debit**: This card is one of the most widely available prepaid travel cards in the U.S. It offers cashback on purchases, which can help offset any transaction fees.

4. **PayPal Prepaid Card**: This card allows you to add money from your bank, by direct deposit or in person at a physical location. You can earn cash back and rewards with PayPal partner merchants. However, a 4% foreign transaction fee applies to international spending.

Remember, it's crucial to compare not just transaction rates but also other factors like ATM withdrawal fees, monthly fees, and the ease of reloading the card. It's also recommended to check the latest information from the card providers as conditions and rates can change.
